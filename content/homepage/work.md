GrumpieZ is a CC0 project giving all governance power to GrumpyDAO. Inspired by Nouns.wtf on Ethereum and the recent on-goings on Solana in Q1 of 2023 we felt it needed change.

GrumpieZ Holders govern GrumpyDAO as well as the treasury. Proposals can be submitted by any holder of 5 GrumpieZ or more and one NFT will act as one vote against each proposal. We aim to create a truly fair governance model similar to nouns which doesn't have a board nor executive body. Utilizing the CC0 IP allows us to waive copyright and allow anyone to utilize our IP in the public domain to further strengthen our brand.

Reject happiness, return to grumpy! Stay tuned to our twitter for updates
